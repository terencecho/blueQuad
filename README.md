blueQuad
========

An Android app that controls my personal quad-copter by means of Bluetooth signals.
version 0.1: works with two LEDs connected to the arduino board. the first LED you can turn on and off using the two buttons on top. The seek bar on bottom can be used to adjust the brightness of the second LED. This version is to just test the bluetooth module.
